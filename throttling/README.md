## Intent
Ensure that a given client is not able to access service resources more than the assigned limit.
![alt text](./etc/throttling-patern.png "Throttling pattern")

## Applicability
The Throttling pattern should be used:

* when a service access needs to be restricted to not have high impacts on the performance of the service.
* when multiple clients are consuming the same service resources and restriction has to be made according to the usage per client.
